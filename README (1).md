### Objective 
To develop and evaluate machine learning models that predict the winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election by state, based on historical election data


### Problem Statement 
The 2024 presidental election is less than three months away. Given historical election data and various features such as candidate votes, total votes, state demographics, and party affiliations, the goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the winner of each state in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The challenge includes handling class imbalances, incorporating relevant features, and evaluating model performance to ensure reliable predictions.


### Goals 
1. Correctly predict the party (democrat or republican) of the candidate who will win each state
2. Based on the winner in each state, calculate who will win the presidency by incorperating the electorial college


### Data Sources 
Data was outsourced from Harvard Dataverse
